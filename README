Compile & Run:
    cs-488 framework is modified, so
    
    $ cd cs488
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    
    $ cd SAILING
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    
    $ ./SAILING Assets/scene.lua
    
    
Test:
    Worked fine on my laptop.
    
    When testing on gl34, make in cs488/ failed with "Clock skew detected".
    
    And when running, the water surface cannot be rendered at all.
    
    Shall bring my own laptop to the demo, if I couldn't make it in time.
  
Objectives:

    1: There is an interactive scene where a ship can be sailed on the sea. 
    There should be islands or rocks in the scene.
    
    2: Some texture is mapped onto the ship.
    
    3: Objects can cast shadow.
    
    4: Water has some degree of transparency. 
       Objects under the water are visible with color blended.
       
    5: There’s a mirror reflection effect on the water surface.
    
    6: Objects under the water have refraction effect.
    
    7: Water does not look still: some dynamic wave effect is simulated.
    
    8: The ship has a chimney that generates smoke by some particle system.
    
    9: Blur effect is applied to background beyond depth of field (DOF).
    
    10: A 2D collision detection system prevents the ship from moving ”into” islands or rocks.
